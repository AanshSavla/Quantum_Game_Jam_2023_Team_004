# Quantum_Game_Jam_2023_Team_004
Welcome to the Quantum Game JAM 2023. We are team number 004. The theme of the current Game JAM was (e)Motion. Love is a divine emotion. Love between any two person connects them and in Quantum Mechanics such intertwined
connection is called as entanglement. So we decided to work around this idea. We kept the name of our game as Entangled Love. This game is similar to the Missionaries and Cannibal game in which there are 3 monks and 3 monsters 
and the task is to make them cross a river so that they all can reach other side of the river bank safely. But on any side if the number of monsters are greater than the number of monks then those monks will get killed. 
For our game we have changed the characters of the game. There are 2 monsters and 2 couples(total 4 people).A men and a women are in love with each other. This makes both of them so much entangled to each other that if one is killed 
then due to the spooky action at a distance other will be killed automatically. In short the state of one depends entirely on the state of the other. Hence totally there are 6 people viz 2 men, 2 women and 2 monsters.
Rules of the game are as follows
1) 1 man can handle 1 monster on any side
2) 2 women can handle 1 monster on any side
3) If a man or a woman gets killed then his/her partner automatically gets killed.
4) Maximize your score
5) If both couples are killed then you lose.
6) If both couples and monsters reach on the other side of the river bank then you win.

There are many improvements needed in the game and we can add even some more features. But during this 48 hours of Quantum Game JAM we steadily made the progress and make our game work!
